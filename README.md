Md and Holden's Final Project for Mr. Konstantinovich's APCS Class Semester 2

Project Idea: A rendition of the puzzle game Osmos in Processing

Features:
- Controllable cell that bounces off walls and accelerates/decelerates
- Player and enemies which can absorb each other
- Sprites from the actual game

Bugs:
- Cell sprites look incorrect when the cell has a large size, and doesn't fix itself when the cell shrinks.

Development Log:
5/31:
-Started coding, made class files

6/1:
-Learned about PVectors, implemented them as instance variables

6/2-6/4:
-Very busy weekend; no work done

6/5:
-Made a player cell that can move based on user input
-Implemented some physics so the player bounces off walls correctly, and accelerates/decelerates
-Added enemy cells and an absorption mechanism which changes rate based on cell radii

6/6:
-Added sprites for cells from the real game
-Fixed image quality loss issue by reloading the image for each cell every few frames
-Made the level contain randomly generated cells that don't touch the player
-Made enemy cells able to absorb each other

6/7:
-Tweaked absorption feature
